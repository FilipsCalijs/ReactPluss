# Advanced React

## Overview
This directory, `advanced`, marks the third stage of my journey in learning React. In this phase, my focus will be on delving into advanced React concepts such as hooks, useEffects, useState, and more. I plan to enhance my understanding and proficiency in utilizing these concepts to build more sophisticated and efficient React applications.

## Projects
I will be working on improving my previous projects, namely the Marvel app and the Coffee Shop app. By applying the knowledge gained from this module, I aim to enhance the functionality and user experience of these applications. The key focus will be on incorporating hooks, utilizing useEffects for better data fetching and state management with useState.
