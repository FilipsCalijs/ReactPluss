# Advanced React

## Overview
This directory, `advanced`, marks the third stage of my journey in learning React. In this phase, my focus will be on delving into advanced React concepts such as hooks, useEffects, useState, and more. I plan to enhance my understanding and proficiency in utilizing these concepts to build more sophisticated and efficient React applications.

## Projects
I will be working on improving my previous projects, namely the Marvel app and the Coffee Shop app. By applying the knowledge gained from this module, I aim to enhance the functionality and user experience of these applications. The key focus will be on incorporating hooks, utilizing useEffects for better data fetching and state management with useState.

## Goals
- Mastering React hooks, useEffects, and useState.
- Applying advanced React concepts to enhance existing projects.
- Improving the overall functionality and user experience of Marvel and Coffee Shop applications.

## Progress Tracking
I will regularly update this README to keep track of my progress and any insights gained during the learning process. Feel free to explore the codebase and follow along with my journey!
